To create an application simply type in a name, select the {{ $device_details.name }} type from the drop down list and click the create button. You should now be taken to the dashboard of your newly created application:

This dashboard may not look like much right now, but this is where you will command and manage a whole fleet of {{ $device_details.name }}s.
